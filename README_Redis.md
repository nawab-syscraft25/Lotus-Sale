```

### 3. **Run Lotus Electronics Chatbot**

```

## Usage

1. **Start the application**: Run `python chat.py`
2. **User identification**: 
   - Enter an existing user ID to continue previous conversation
   - Press Enter to create a new user ID
3. **Chat commands**:
   - Type your message normally
   - `stats` - Show user statistics
   - `clear` - Clear conversation history
   - `quit`/`exit`/`bye` - Exit application

## Redis Memory Configuration

You can customize the Redis memory settings by modifying the `RedisMemory` initialization:

```python
redis_memory = RedisMemory(
    redis_host='localhost',    # Redis server host
    redis_port=6379,          # Redis server port  
    redis_db=0,               # Redis database number
    ttl_seconds=1800          # Conversation expiry time (30 minutes)
)
```

## Memory Management

- **TTL (Time To Live)**: Conversations automatically expire after 30 minutes
- **Message limit**: Only last 50 messages per user are stored
- **Context window**: AI uses last 20 messages for generating responses
- **Multiple users**: Each user ID gets isolated conversation history

## Troubleshooting

1. **Redis connection error**: Make sure Redis server is running on localhost:6379
2. **Memory issues**: Check Redis memory usage with `redis-cli info memory`
3. **Permission errors**: Ensure Redis has write permissions

## Redis CLI Commands

Useful Redis commands for debugging:
```bash
# Connect to Redis CLI
redis-cli

# List all user keys
KEYS user_messages:*

# Get user conversation
GET user_messages:your_user_id

# Delete user conversation  
DEL user_messages:your_user_id

# Check TTL of a key
TTL user_messages:your_user_id
```
